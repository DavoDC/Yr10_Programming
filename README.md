# Year 10 Programming
These are my Programming class projects from high school, **Year 10 (2015)**.

This class introduced me to programming, specifically using the **[Visual Basic 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)) (VB)** programming language. It was my first experience with coding, and all our projects were written in VB.

While I enjoyed the experience at the time, it wasn't until three years later, during my Computer Science studies at university in **2018**, that I reignited my passion for programming. Since then, my programming knowledge has significantly deepened, and my appreciation for it has grown.

**Note**: This repo was created retrospectively, in **2023**.
